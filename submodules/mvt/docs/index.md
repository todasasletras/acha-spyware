# Mobile Verification Toolkit

Mobile Verification Toolkit (MVT) is a tool to facilitate the [consensual forensic analysis](introduction.md#consensual-forensics) of Android and iOS devices, for the purpose of identifying traces of compromise.

It has been developed and released by the [Amnesty International Security Lab](https://securitylab.amnesty.org) in July 2021 in the context of the [Pegasus Project](https://forbiddenstories.org/about-the-pegasus-project/) along with [a technical forensic methodology](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2021/07/forensic-methodology-report-how-to-catch-nso-groups-pegasus/). It continues to be maintained by Amnesty International and other contributors.


In this documentation you will find instructions on how to install and run the `mvt-ios` and `mvt-android` commands, and guidance on how to interpret the extracted results.
