# Records extracted by `mvt-ios`

In this page you can find a (reasonably) up-to-date breakdown of the files created by MVT when performing an analysis of logs, backups or filesystem dumps.

## Records extracted by `check-fs` or `check-backup`

### `analytics.json`

!!! info "Availability"
    Backup (if encrypted): :material-close:
    Full filesystem dump: :material-check:

This JSON file is created by mvt-ios' `Analytics` module. The module extracts records from the plists inside the SQLite databases located at *private/var/Keychains/Analytics/\*.db*, which contain various analytics information regarding networking, certificate-pinning, TLS, etc. failures.

If indicators are provided through the command-line, processes and domains are checked against all fields of the plist. Any matches are stored in *analytics_detected.json*.

These records contains detailed information on the source and installation of the app.

If indicators are provided through the command-line, processes and application ids are checked against the app name of each application. It also flags any applications not installed from the AppStore. Any matches are stored in *applications_detected.json*.

For example, you might see HTTP requests part of an exploitation chain performed by an iOS service attempting to download a first stage malicious payload.

If indicators are provided through the command-line, they are checked against the requested URL. Any matches are stored in *cache_files_detected.json*.
